# Shoppy iOS Client
> Shoppy is an unofficial alternative client for [shoppy.gg iOS application](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/shoppy-ecommerce/id1486173778?l=en) present on the iOS App Store. I decided to make this alternative because the official application was slow, bugged and not using the full power of the proposed API.

## Install
_I'll try to launch it on App Store as soon as application reach version 1.2!_ You can take a look to projects to see what's remaining.

## Screenshots
> Here are a couple of screenshots, the applications contains a lot more to see, use it by yourself to discover everything!
